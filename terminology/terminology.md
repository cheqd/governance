# Terminology used in the Governance Framework

It is important to use consistent and plain language, to ensure that there is a clear understanding of this Governance Framework.

For this reason, this Governance Framework will utilise the key words:

> * "MUST",
> * "MUST NOT",
> * "REQUIRED",
> * "SHALL",
> * "SHALL NOT",
> * "SHOULD",
> * "SHOULD NOT",
> * "RECOMMENDED",
> * "MAY", and
> * "OPTIONAL"

These terms are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)

Generally, this Governance Framework will use non-prescriptive language, and will focus more on MAY and SHOULD, rather than SHALL and MUST.

The Governance Framework MAY also make use of the terms, conventions and patterns in the [ToIP Metamodel](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Governance+Metamodel+Specification). It is desirable to become a ToIP compliant Network.

cheqd-specific Terms SHALL be defined in the [Glossary of terms](README.md), a Controlled Document of the Governance Framework.
