| **Agent**                               | A software program or process used by or acting on behalf of an Entity to interact with other Agents or with the cheqd Network or other distributed ledgers. Agents are of two types: Edge Agents run at the edge of the network on a local device; Cloud Agents run remotely on a server or cloud hosting service. Agents require access to a Wallet in order to perform cryptographic operations on behalf of the Entity they represent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**       | A protocol for communicating between Agents to form Connections, exchange Credentials, and have other secure private Interactions.

| **Anonym**                              | A DID used exactly once, so it cannot be contextualized or correlated beyond that single usage. See also Pseudonym and Verinym.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Anywise**                             | A non-reciprocal relationship rooted in the Identity of one party, where the other party is the public (a faceless “other” that can be instantiated without bound). For an Organization to issue publicly Verifiable Credentials, its Issuer DID must be on a public ledger such as cheqd. It is thus an Anywise DID—a DID to which any other Entity may refer without coordination. The term “public DID” is sometimes used as a casual synonym for “Anywise DID”. However, “public DID” is deprecated because it is ambiguous, i.e., it may refer to a DID that is world-visible but usable only in pairwise mode, or to a DID that is not published in a central location but nonetheless used in many contexts, or to a DID that is both publicly visible and used in Anywise mode. Compare N-wise and Pairwise.                                                                                                              |
| **ATOM**                                | The exchange token that runs and transacts natively on the Cosmos ledger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Attribute**                           | An Identity trait, property, or quality of an Entity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Authentic data**                      | A relatively new term, intended to replace 'Self-sovereign identity'.

| **Connection**                          | A cryptographically verifiable communications channel established using an Agent-to-Agent Protocol between two DIDs representing two Entities and their associated Agents. Connections may be Edge-to-Edge Connections or Cloud-to-Cloud Connections. Connections may be used to exchange Verifiable Credentials or for any other communications purpose. Connections may be encrypted and decrypted using the Public Keys and Private Keys for each DID. A Connection may be temporary or it may last as long as the two Entities desire to keep it. Two Entities may have multiple Connections between them, however each Connection must be between a unique pair of DIDs. A relationship between more than two Entities may be modeled either as Pairwise connections between all of the Entities (Peering) or each Entity can form a Connection with an Entity representing a Group.                                         |
| **Connection Invitation**               | An Agent-to-Agent Protocol message type sent from one Entity to a second Entity to invite the second Entity to send a Connection Request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| **Credential**                          | <p>A digital assertion containing a set of Claims made by an Entity about itself or another Entity. Credentials are a subset of Identity Data. A Credential is based on a Credential Definition. The Entity described by the Claims is called the Subject of the Credential. The Entity creating the Credential is called the Issuer. The Entity holding the issued Credential is called the Holder. The Entity to whom a Credential is presented is generally called the Relying Party, and specifically called the Verifier if the Credential is a Verifiable Credential. Once issued, a Credential is typically stored by an Agent. (In cheqd's infrastructure, Credentials are never stored on the Ledger.)<br><br>Credentials are very broad in their potential use: Examples of Credentials include college transcripts, driver licenses, health insurance cards, and building permits. See also Verifiable Credential.</p> |
| **Credential Definition (CredDef)**     | A machine-readable definition of the semantic structure of a Credential based on one or more Schemas. Credential Definitions are stored on the cheqd Network. Credential Definitions must include an Issuer Public Key. Credential Definitions facilitate interoperability of Credentials and Proofs across multiple Issuers, Holders, and Verifiers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
